# Models

This directory contains three categories of EnergyPlus models representing the existing building stock in the State of California. The included energy models cover Single-Family, Low-rise Multifamily, and Nonresidential prototype buildings. These IDF files are built using EnergyPlus 23.1, and require this version of the engine to run properly.

If an alternative energy modeling platform is preferred, users can refer to the scorecards available in the Specification folder to develop equivalent models.
