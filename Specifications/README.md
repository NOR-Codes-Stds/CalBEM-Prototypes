Note on Specifications

This repository contains three scorecard files used for generating EnergyPlus input files. These include scorecards for Single-Family, Low-rise Multifamily, and Nonresidential prototype models. 

The scorecards are compiled based on an existing stock analysis of the State of California and provide all the necessary input data required to develop the energy models.
